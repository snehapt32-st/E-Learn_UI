TASK DESCRIPTION

This project is a frontend e-learning website developed as part of my internship. The main goal of this project was to design and build a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface for an online learning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The website represents a typical e-learning platform where users can explore courses, view different learning categories, and get an overall idea of how an online education system looks and works from the frontend perspective.

The E-Learning Platform is designed with a modern UI to provide a smooth user experience. The homepage includes a visually appealing hero section with a call-to-action, encouraging users to start learning online. Navigation is simple and intuitive, allowing users to move easily between sections such as Home, Categories, Courses, About Us, and Contact.

The project focuses purely on frontend development, without backend integration. However, it follows real-world design principles used in modern web applications.
